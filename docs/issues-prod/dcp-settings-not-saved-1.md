# Issue: DCP Settings Silently Not Saved to DB

**Issue ID:** dcp-settings-not-saved-1
**Status:** Completed
**Priority:** 🔴 High
**Created:** 2026-03-19
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-20 03:45

## Overview
`buildSettingsData()` in `handlers.server.ts` was never updated when new direct Prisma columns were added to `DesignSettings`. As a result, ~40 fields are tracked dirty in the DCP UI, appear to save (success toast shown), but are silently dropped — the DB upsert never writes them. On page reload, `mergeSettings` correctly reads the columns but they're still at their default values since they were never persisted.

Also: the configure page save effect does not update the discard baselines for 5 bundle-level media/tier fields (`promoBannerBgImage`, `promoBannerBgImageCrop`, `loadingGif`, `tierConfig`, `showStepTimeline`) after a successful save, so clicking Discard after saving reverts those fields to the initial page-load values.

## Progress Log

### 2026-03-19 23:15 - Starting fix
- Identified all missing fields by cross-referencing Prisma schema with `buildSettingsData`
- Fix: add all 40 missing direct columns to `buildSettingsData` in `handlers.server.ts`
- Secondary fix: update discard baselines in configure route after successful save

### 2026-03-19 23:30 - Completed
- Phase 1: Added 40 missing direct columns to `buildSettingsData` in `handlers.server.ts` (buttonAddedBgColor/TextColor, buttonTextTransform/LetterSpacing, productCardHoverTranslateY/TransitionDuration, tileQuantityBadge*, modalCloseButton*, focusOutline*, searchInput*, skeleton*, tierPill* ×11, loadingOverlay*, widgetStyle/bottomSheet*/emptySlot*)
- Phase 2: Full-page configure route — update 5 discard baseline refs (promoBannerBgImage, promoBannerBgImageCrop, loadingGif, tierConfig, showStepTimeline) inside save success effect. Product-page configure route — update originalLoadingGifRef after markAsSaved()
- Phase 3: ESLint clean (0 errors), committed
- Files changed: `app/routes/app/app.design-control-panel/handlers.server.ts`, `app/routes/app/app.bundles.full-page-bundle.configure.$bundleId/route.tsx`, `app/routes/app/app.bundles.product-page-bundle.configure.$bundleId/route.tsx`

### 2026-03-20 00:15 - DCP modal bundle-type filtering + Analytics improvements
- NavigationSidebar: Bundle Header section now gated with `{isFullPage && ...}` — Tabs + Header Text hidden for product-page bundles
- NavigationSidebar: Modal Close Button + Widget Style items now gated with `{!isFullPage && ...}` — hidden for full-page bundles
- Analytics: Banner (UTM not enabled / no data) moved to top of page, above PixelStatusCard
- Analytics: PixelStatusCard redesigned — colored status strip, pulsing dot indicator, cleaner layout, larger CTA button
- Files: `NavigationSidebar.tsx`, `app.attribution.tsx`

### 2026-03-20 03:15 - Bundle Step Bar nav section + Empty State gating
- NavigationSidebar: Added "Bundle Step Bar" section (full-page only) with 4 child items: Completed Step, Incomplete Step, Progress Bar, Step Bar Tabs — previously these SettingsPanel cases were unreachable via nav
- NavigationSidebar: Gated "Empty State" nav item to `!isFullPage` (product-page only) — full-page bundles have no empty state concept
- Files: `NavigationSidebar.tsx`

## Phases Checklist
- [x] Phase 1: Fix `buildSettingsData` — add all missing direct columns
- [x] Phase 2: Fix configure route discard baseline refs after save
- [x] Phase 3: ESLint, lint, commit
- [x] Phase 4: DCP modal bundle-type settings filtering
- [x] Phase 5: Analytics banner position + PixelStatusCard redesign
- [x] Phase 6: BundleFooterPreview — toggle filtered by bundle type; product-page DCP no longer shows full-page footer layouts
- [x] Phase 7: Search Input nav item gated with isFullPage — only shown for full-page bundles (product-page widget has no search functionality)
- [x] Phase 8: Bundle Step Bar section added to NavigationSidebar (full-page only) — 4 child items now reachable
- [x] Phase 9: Empty State nav item gated to product-page only
- [x] Phase 10: Bundle Step Bar section removed — CSS variables emitted but no widget JS/CSS consumes them; dead UI
- [x] Phase 11: Widget Style preview redesigned — mobile frame showing slot cards + bottom-sheet panel with product grid; no broken images; CSS vars wired live

**Status:** Completed
